# Netflix Analysis

If you're anything like me, you've spent a good portion of lockdown watching netflix. 

But just how much Netflix? Now you can see! 

This project creates an animated bar chart detailing the minutes spent watching your top n shows

## Requirements
You need to run netflix_analysis.py first, and then use the jupyter notebook to create the graph animation which will save to a video.
